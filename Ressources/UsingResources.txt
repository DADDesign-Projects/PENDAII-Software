There are two ways to use resources (fonts, images, etc.) in the project:

1. Embedded resources (recommended for development)
	To embed the resources directly into the code, uncomment line 113 in the main.h file: #define FONTH
	This method is convenient during development, especially when using the Debug build, 
	since both code and data are loaded into RAM.
	⚠️ Warning: This option consumes a lot of RAM and is not compatible with 
	the Release build, as the STM32H750 only has 128 KB of internal flash.

2. Resources stored in QSPI flash (recommended for Release)
	To generate a Release build, you must:
		Comment out line 113 in the main.h file: //#define FONTH
		Flash the resources to QSPI memory using the following utility:
