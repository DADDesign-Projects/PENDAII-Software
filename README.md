# PENDAII-Software
PENDAII-Software is the new version of the software framework specifically designed to take full advantage of the PENDAII stereo hardware.

## Introduction
PENDAII Software is a collection of audio effects built on an advanced framework, specifically designed for the PENDAII Hardware platform ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/DADDesign-Projects/PENDAII-Hardware)). You can use this framework to easily develop your own high-quality audio effect pedals, focusing entirely on signal processing while the framework handles all hardware complexities.

## Key Features
### Audio Effects

#### Delay

- Main delay adjustable from 0.100 to 1.5 seconds.
- Second delay line available with selectable rhythmic subdivisions.
- Modulation applied to the delayed signal for subtle chorus/flanger-type effects.
- Independent bass and treble control on echoes to fine-tune their tonal character.
	
#### PENDA Software Framework

- Full Integration: Seamlessly works with PENDAII Hardware and DAISY Seed.
- Optimized Audio Processing: Built-in support for the Audio CODEC, handling initialization and real-time processing.
- Memory Management:
    - SDRAM for large, volatile data storage.
    - QSPI Flash for fast, non-volatile storage, including file persistence and flashing utilities.

- Graphical User Interface (GUI):
    - TFT Display with ST7789 driver support.
    - DaisySeedGFX2 for advanced visualization and PendaUI for customizable user interface management.
    - Interactive controls via footswitches (tap tempo), rotary encoders, and MIDI protocol.

- Development Environment:
    - Built with STM32Cube, offering a modular and extensible architecture for easy customization.

With PENDAII Hardware, this framework provides an all-in-one solution for pedal effect development, eliminating the need for low-level hardware management.
